// Traditionally this file has held the lastest misra standard.
// There have been two standards published: MISRA 1998 and MISRA 2004.
// We have two files bearing options that, respectively, activate
// these standards: au-misra1.lnt and au-misra2.lnt
// Currently MISRA 2004 is the preferred standard.
// Prior to publishing the 2nd standard, the file au-misra.lnt was
// used to hold the then current misra standard.  We are maintaining
// this file to afford backward compatibility.

	http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/data_sheet/MPC5602D.pdf?fr=g
 
Board:
  8Mhz external crystal

Supported compilers:
  Code Warrior
 
Info:	
  MPC5602B
  CPU:		 e200z0h (VLE only)
  Freq:		 16 Mhz
  Flash: 	 256 kB, code flash
             64 kB, data flash
  RAM:       24 kB, ECC RAM
  
Memory Map:
 0x0000_0000 -> 0x0003_ffff   Flash
 0x0080_0000 -> 0x0080_ffff   Data Flash
 0x4000_0000 -> 0x4000_5fff   SRAM
 
NOTE! In Mcu.c only board specific clocks and pin muxing are setup and there is no config tool support. 
So, in order to use for instance FlexCan 3 you need to iniatilize FlexCan3 power control register i.e. ME.PCTL[19].R = 0x01;
in EcuM callout or modify an own version of Mcu.c. See Mcu_InitClock in Mcu.c for further info.  

== ADC ==
NOTE! It ADC1 is used, this must be powered by connecting AVDDSUPPLY to PD12 (PJ3.13) and 
AVSSSUPPLY to PB11 (PJ5.12)

== SPI == 

Adding a SPI EEPROM (Microship 25LC160B)

To the left are the pins as they are names in XPC56xxMBSCH (schema for the main board, page 11 of 12)

    CS    - Connect to PJ1-11
    /WP   - High
    /HOLD - Low
    Rest of the pins are obvious
 
    Connected with 5V logic

---------------------------------- NOTE ----------------------------------
  The xPC560S EVB v1.0.1 manual is total crap in chapter "3.8 Pin Mapping"
  Known errors:
   PJ1
     PCS0.2, should be PCS1_0     
   PJ9-Port F
     As I understand it should map to Port F. However, PCS1_1 is
     located on PCR[78]=PF[8] on CPU is connected to PF[0] on PJ9!!     
---------------------------------- NOTE ----------------------------------

 PJ1 Connector will have the following layout 
 (With ArcCore internal harness and SO/SI as seen from memory):

                 PJ1 
               1-X  X-2
               3-X  X-4 
               5-X  X-6
    SO/Brown   7-X  X-8  SI/Orange
    SCK/Blue   9-X  X-10  
              11-X  X-12
              13-X  X-14
              15-X  X-16  
    Gnd/Black 17-X  X-18 VCC/Red   
       
CS/Green should be connected to PB12 (CS1_0 according to ref. manual). This is on PJ5.13.

 If software CS is used Connector PJ2 and PJ[0] is used for that
                 PJ2

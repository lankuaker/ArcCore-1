Board:
  8Mhz external crystal.

Supported compilers:
  gcc, Code Warrior, Diab. GCC does not support VLE so in order to use you must remove 
  
  # CFG (y/n) macros
CFG=PPC E200Z0 MPC55XX MPC563XM MPC5634M BRD_MPC5634M_TRK #VLE

in build_config.mk
  
  
SystemTick:
  decrementer is used for generating system clock

  Flash: 	 1,5MB, flash
  RAM:       94K, ECC
  
Memory Map:
 0x0000_0000 -> 0x0017_FFFF   Flash
 0x4000_0000 -> 0x4001_77FF   SRAM
 
CAN and LIN: In order to use CAN or LIN the MC33905 circuit need to be initialized accordingly using DSPI. 
             Contact Freescale support for source code. Same init as for mpc5604b_trk.
             
             CAN C only supports 32 mailboxes although CAN A supports 64...weird...

             CAN C never tested, only run in loopback mode.
             
PWM: For channel configuration See chapter 21.1.2.1 Channel descriptions. 
    NOTE: Not all channels can be used as PWM.
          Not all channels can use all modes,
          Not all channels have internal counter
          
             
SPI_B: Tested ok with external eeprom.

 P7 Connector will have the following layout 
 (With ArcCore internal harness and SO/SI as seen from memory):
                  P7 
               1-X  X-2  CS/Green
               3-X  X-4 
               5-X  X-6
    SO/Brown   7-X  X-8  SI/Orange
    SCK/Blue   9-X  X-10 
    			 DSPI 

SPI_C: Never tested

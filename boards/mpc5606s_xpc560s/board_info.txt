Board:
  8Mhz external crystal

Supported compilers:
  Code Warrior
 
Info:	
  MPC5606S
  CPU:		 e200z0h (VLE only)
  Freq:		 64 Mhz
  Flash: 	 1.0 MB, primary
             64K, data flash
  RAM:       48K, ECC
             160K, Graphics RAM (not ECC)
  
Memory Map:
 0x0000_0000 -> 0x000f_ffff   Flash
 0x0080_0000 -> 0x0080_ffff   Data Flash
 0x4000_0000 -> 0x4000_bfff   SRAM
 0x6000_0000 -> 0x6002_7fff   Graphics SRAM
 
NOTE! In Mcu.c only board specific clocks and pin muxing are setup and there is no config tool support. 
So, in order to use for instance FlexCan 3 you need to iniatilize FlexCan3 power control register i.e. ME.PCTL[19].R = 0x01;
in EcuM callout or modify an own version of Mcu.c. See Mcu_InitClock in Mcu.c for further info.

Adding a SPI EEPROM (Microship 25LC160B)

To the left are the pins as they are names in XPC56xxMBSCH (schema for the main board, page 11 of 12)

    Rest of the pins are obvious
 
    Connected with 5V logic

---------------------------------- NOTE ----------------------------------
  The xPC560S EVB v1.0.1 manual is total crap in chapter "3.8 Pin Mapping"
  Known errors:
   PJ1
     PCS0.2, should be PCS1_0     
   PJ9-Port F
     As I understand it should map to Port F. However, PCS1_1 is
     located on PCR[78]=PF[8] on CPU is connected to PF[0] on PJ9!!

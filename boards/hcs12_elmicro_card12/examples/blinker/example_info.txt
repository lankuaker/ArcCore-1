A simple application that flashes the LED on the board. Default
frequency is 1 Hz. The frequency can be changed by sending a
new period in a CAN message. The first 32 bit in a message with 
CAN Id 100 is treated as the new period (in system ticks => 0x000003E8 == 1s). 
A CAN message with CAN Id 102 is transmitted every 1 s to indicate
the current period. Signals coded in BigEndian. Baudrate 125 kbit/s
